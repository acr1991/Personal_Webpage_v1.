35!

Hi Everybody,

Welcome to my personal website. If youâ€™re reading this, then you must be either one of my classmates, teachers or any other acquaintance that is curious about what iâ€™ve been and will be doing in the future. After a six year career at Apple, It was time for something new. The pleasure of serving all kinds of awesome customers and businesses has been put on hold because I decided to step away and develop my personal skillset in coding, app development and any other cool stuff that I will come across along the way.

My interests include

* Web development
* Customer relationship management 
* Cutting edge technology like AI and all the other cool buzzwords
* Photography 
* World traveling and adventure sports such as mountain hiking and scuba diving. Iâ€™ve been an advanced open water diver for over 15 years now. =) ðŸ¤¿
* Just being outside and being human ðŸŒ±

Thanks for joining me here, 

Feel free to connect with me on all  of my socials listed below, and in person of course. ðŸ˜ƒ 

Talk soon,

-Alexander
